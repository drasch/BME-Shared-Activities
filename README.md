# BME-Shared-Activities

Thanks for your interest in our MATLAB-based BME Escape Room!

You can get started by downloading all of the source files and then running the Run_BME303L_EscapeRoom.m file on your computer.
From there, read the instructions, and try to work your way through the game.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to contact Lauren Heckelman at LNH7@duke.edu.
